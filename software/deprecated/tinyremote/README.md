# TinyRemote

This is tinyremote, which is built for Linux to make life a tad easier by combining a key listener and a video capture module into one.

It is provided as an example and is not of much use lately, so feel free to look around and provide feedback if you wish.

There is another version WiP currently, which should replace the functionality given here.
