# Emulator

The emulator for tinysys is aimed to be fast instead of clock-accurate.

It implements functionality of all onboard peripherals except the ESP32 module, which is wired to read from keyboard input and write to the terminal of the host PC instead.

Please see [EMULATOR](../emulator/README.md) for more information about how the emulator can be used for development.
