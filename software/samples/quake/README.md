# Quake port for tinysys

Based on work from
https://github.com/FantomJAC/quakembd

This one is easy to build, just use:

```
make
```

on command line from the root folder and you'll end up with a quake.elf binary.

Copy this file to your sdcard next to your ID1 folder (quake game files for version 1.09) and you should be good to go.

NOTE: Emulator version has a small glitch reading files, which will be fixed soon.
