Drop the contents of this folder to the root of a FAT32 formatted sdcard, place it into the tinysys board's sdcard slot and reboot.
This will get tinysys to reboot from the .rom image on this folder and you'll have all the samples precompiled so you can test them quickly.
NOTE: The elf files in the sys/bin directory can be run from any folder, so you might want to place any new binaries that you wish to use as 'commands' into that folder.
